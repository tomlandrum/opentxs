            // increment.
            //
            // Since we are calculating the MINIMUM that must be
            // processed per round, let's also calculate the MOST that
            // could be traded between these two offers. Then let's mod
            // that to the Scale and remove the remainder, then divide
            // by the Scale and multiply by the price (to get the MOST
            // that would have to be paid, if the offers fulfilled each
            // other to the maximum possible according to their limits.)

// $10 bid came in, it would immediately process our orders and be done.
// If I was ALREADY BIDDING at $10, and an $8 ask came in, it would
// immediately process our orders and be done.
//
// So the question is, who gets WHAT price? Does the transaction occur
// at $8 or at $10? Do I get my price limit, or does he? Do you split
// the difference? I decided what to do... here is the REASONING, then
// CONCLUSION:
//
// REASONING:
//
// If I'm already selling for $8, and a $10 bid comes in, he's only
// going to choose me since I'm the lowest one on the market (and first
// in line for my price.) Otherwise he has no reason not to choose one
// of the others who are also available at that low price, instead of
// choosing me. The server would just pick whoever was next in line.
//
// And the other sellers also do have a right to get their sales
// completed, since they ARE willing to sell for $8. Obviously none of
// the other bids wanted me so far, even though I'm the best deal on my
// market, or I would have been snapped up already. But I'm still here.
// The bidder shouldn't pay more than fair market rate, which means more
// than whatever my competition is charging, and as long as I'm not
// getting any less than my own ask limit, then I HAVE agreed to the
// price, and it's fair. (I always could have set it higher.)
//
// The prices also were different when I came onto the market. Things
// were different then. Obviously since I'm still here, I wasn't ALWAYS
// the lowest price. Maybe in fact the price was $3 before, and I had a
// std::int64_t-standing trade there that said not to sell for less than
// $8 (with a stop order too, so it didn't even activate until then.)
// THE POINT? I COULD have had the best price on the market THEN,
// whatever it was, simply by checking it and then setting my limit to
// match. But I didn't choose that. Instead, I set it to $8 limit, and
// then my trade sat there waiting for 6 months or god knows how
// std::int64_t
// until it became valid, when market
// conditions became more favorable to my trade.
// THEN my trade, at some point, became the lowest price on the market
// (finally) so when someone's brand new $10 limit bid comes in, he ALSO
// deserves the best price on the market, just as I had the same
// opportunity to get the best price when *I* first entered the market.
// And since I am now first in line with $8 as the best price in the
// market, he should get it at that $8 price. We have both agreed to it!
// It is within BOTH of our limits! Notice we also BOTH got our fair
// shot up front to have the absolute best price, and instead we set our
// limit outside of what prices were available in order to wait for
// better offers.
//
//
// CONCLUSION:
//
// THEREFORE: The new Trade should always get the better deal in this
// function, in the sense that he gets the best price possible (the
// limit) from the other trade (that was already on the market.) And he
// gets the number-one best deal available from that side of the market.
// The existing trade does NOT get theOffer's limit price, but theOffer
// DOES get the other trade's limit price. This is how it should work.
// We are not going to "split the difference" -- although we might split
// a percentage off the difference as a server fee. I haven't thought
// that through yet (it's an idea suggested by Andrew Muck.)

// Return True if Trade should stay on the Cron list for more
// processing. Return False if it should be removed and deleted.
